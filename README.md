MKBRUTUS
========

Password bruteforcer for MikroTik devices and boxes running RouterOS.

**Project Website:** http://mkbrutusproject.github.io/MKBRUTUS/

## Summary

Some boxes running MikroTik RouterOS (3.x or newer) have API port enabled for administrative purposes (by default at port 8728/TCP) instead or alongside SSH, Winbox or HTTPS. This is an attack vector as it could be possible to perform a bruteforce to obtain valid credentials if access to this port is not restricted. The API uses a specific proprietary protocol so some code published by the vendor is included.
